# CHESS
A pretty basic chess game made in rust. I am not saying this is a fast implementation of chess, no bitboards or whatever are being used, but It is playable.

## future additions
I would like to figure out all this chess programing stuff and make a real contender for a fast, efficient chess game, and also I would like to impliment a basic
board evaluation feature to create a simple chess bot. That would be fun.
